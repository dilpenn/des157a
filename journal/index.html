        <date>January 31, 2023</date>
        <div class="paragraphs">
            <p>After reading <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best practices for form design"</a> by Salim Ansari, I realized there is much more to designing online forms than I thought. For example, the form should start with simple questions and move on to complex ones towards the end. This way, the user will be more inclined to complete the form. The visuals can be used to give cues, making the form easier to understand. This includes using different colors for feedback messages, highlighting the selected field, sizing input fields according to the appropriate input length, and placing the labels outside of the input fields. These strategies help enhance the user's experience.</p>
            <p>In my experience, <a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/89909230280024774-interaction-designer-android-input/?distance=50&q=designer">Google Careers</a> has user-friendly application forms that utilize the described design strategies. The form is split up into several sections, which reduces cognitive load. They use a variety of input fields like text input boxes, dropdown menus, and checkboxes. When the user doesn't fill out a required field, both the field and the label turn red and an alert message is displayed at the bottom. Considering that people generally apply to many jobs at once, creating a smooth form-filling process will alleviate a lot of stress for the user. A screenshot of the form can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hWN3gIUqkeCqWjYoA44CXaYHH4_PUzhh/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
