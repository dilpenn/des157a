            <p>In <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">"Game Design UX Best Practices,"</a> Amir Dori describes features of games and how to best design them for the user. Buttons, for example, can be utilized by the user to make a choice. Often, they appear in pop-up messages. The choice that is beneficial to the game should be placed on the right side and be in a color that evokes a posiitve message (like green). Until I read it, I did not realize how common this design strategy was in games.</p>
            <p>Dori also explains comfort-to-reach areas on a screen, which are the areas that are most easily assessible to a user who is using a mobile device. The most important features of the game should be in these zones so the user does not struggle while interacting with the game. Since I will be designing a web game for my next project, I wonder if this rule also applies to desktop games as well. I would assume that it is best practice to keep significant elements around the center, but are there any other spatial rules that I should consider?</p>

            <p>I took this photo on a roadtrip with my friends up the Pacific Northwest in December of 2021. These are some buildings across from the Public Market in Downtown Seattle. The layered buildings in different colors creates an interesting, dynamic composition. I like the out-of-context feel to this image, since it is a zoomed-in shot of mostly the top halves of the buildings. This was a composition style I wanted to practice. Although I chose photos I took on this trip for my collection, I suppose it could be more interesting to focus on photos that I specifically experimented with different photography techniques.</p>
            <p>This is an image of a sunset at the beach. The soft pink and orange tones are beautifully blended that it almost looks like a monochromatic photo. This color scheme looks almost surreal, as if it is a scene from a Wes Anderson movie. There is a lot of depth to this photo, with the sand and plants in the foreground and the gradual fade-out of the mountains in the background. The clouds are a little mysterious. Their dispersed form almost makes them appear like smoke that has come from afar.</p>

            <p>Ever come across a photo that doesn't immediately make sense on first glance? In <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">"10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills,"</a> Michael Gonchar describes the process of engaging in visual thinking. This involves paying attention to more detail and asking questions about the photo, like "What's going on in this picture?". Gonchar argues that this process can also improve close reading skills. I enjoy looking at interpretable images because they often initiate discussion. Despite this, I believe this is a difficult concept to implement into one's work (like photography, art, or design).</p>
            <p>A visually inspiring site is <a href="https://water.falmec.com/en/">Water by Falmec</a>, which is a kitchen appliance site. This version of their site specifically focuses on their sink collection. The opening image spans the entire window and creates interactive water ripples onto the surface of the water as the user moves their mouse. Although I would consider this too distracting or exessive for a retail site, the visuals are aesthetically pleasing and the animations are subtle.</p>

        <date>February 7, 2023</date>
        <div class="paragraphs">
            <p>As stated in <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">"Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows"</a> by Naema Baskanderi, modals/overlays are small pop-up windows that display over the main window. Users do not have access to the main window until the modal window is interacted with. These windows are especially useful with form submissions, which can prompt the user with an error or warning. The user should be given the option to either exit the window or take another action.</p>
            <p>The author indicates that modal windows should appear <em>in response to</em> users' actions. When I enter a retail site and a window pops up after a short delay, I automatically assume it is an advertisement or some other marketing tactic. I almost never pay attention to the content of the window and exit it immediately. If a window pops up on a form I am submitting, on the other hand, then I know the information on the pop-up is going to be relevant to the action I took to submit the form.</p>

        <h2 class="page_title">Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        <date>January 31, 2023</date>
        <div class="paragraphs">
            <p>After reading <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best practices for form design"</a> by Salim Ansari, I realized there is much more to designing online forms than I thought. For example, the form should start with simple questions and move on to complex ones towards the end. This way, the user will be more inclined to complete the form. The visuals can be used to give cues, making the form easier to understand. This includes using different colors for feedback messages, highlighting the selected field, sizing input fields according to the appropriate input length, and placing the labels outside of the input fields. These strategies help enhance the user's experience.</p>
            <p>In my experience, <a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/89909230280024774-interaction-designer-android-input/?distance=50&q=designer">Google Careers</a> has user-friendly application forms that utilize the described design strategies. The form is split up into several sections, which reduces cognitive load. They use a variety of input fields like text input boxes, dropdown menus, and checkboxes. When the user doesn't fill out a required field, both the field and the label turn red and an alert message is displayed at the bottom. Considering that people generally apply to many jobs at once, creating a smooth form-filling process will alleviate a lot of stress for the user. A screenshot of the form can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hWN3gIUqkeCqWjYoA44CXaYHH4_PUzhh/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
