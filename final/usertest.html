            <h2>Significant Observations</h2>
            <p>1.) After completing the Mad Lib form, each user expected to have a button to return back to the form. They opted to refreshing the browser when they couldn't find it.</p>
            <p>2.) It was clear to each user that the image in the dream bubble changed according to the activity they chose.</p>
            <p>3.) The overall experience seemed enjoyable: completing the form, reading the story they generated, and seeing a different image pop up with each activity choice.</p>

            <h2>Planned Improvements</h2>
            <p>1.) Add a "Generate Another Dream" button to take the user back to the form.</p>
            <p>2.) Add CSS animations to the inserted activity images. This will help to aid the imagery of the story and make the overall experience more engaging.</p>
            <p>3.) Improve the positioning of the images and other elements. I do not plan on making this project completely responsive, but it looks odd when the cat and food jar appear to be floating when the viewport isn't 1200x750.</p>
