        <h1>Final Project Design Brief</h1>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>I will be improving my Mad Lib project -- which creates a story of a cat's dream --  by improving visuals and adding more animations.</p>

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>I intend to improve this project both visually and with user interactions. Currently, the journey from first encountering the site to completing the Mad Lib form is very underwhelming. The most exciting aspect is the "zzz" sleep text above the image of the cat turning into a dream bubble, which is actually not exciting at all. The Mad Lib plot is written from the viewpoint of a dreaming cat, so the design and interactions should reflect the ridiculous nature of the story.</p>

            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>My initial intention when designing this project was to create a fun and playful design. I accomplished this with bright colors and the rounded features of the elements and font. I want to maintain the mood but improve the overall cohesion of the elements. Since the cat is sleeping on a surface, the form could be displayed on an object that is placed next to the cat (like a food bin, for example).</p>

            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>The last element on the form allows the user to select an activity for the cat from a dropdown of options. The 3 choices are: partying, modeling, and exercising. These unrealistic, ridiculous choices deserve some visuals. After submitting the form, I want an animated image within the dream bubble displaying the option that the user has chosen. If the user chooses "modeling," for example, an image of the cat in a ridiculous, model-like pose should appear within the bubble.</p>

            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>I hope that users will have fun while interacting with the Mad Lib. Not only may the generated story be ridiculous, but so will the accompanying animations and visuals. This also adds a surprise factor for first-time users who will not expect changing animations. In order to make the experience a fun one, I need to fix usability issues as well. When an input box is in focus, it jitters a little bit and pushes the elements below it away. I also need to include a "Generate another dream" button so users can return to a blank form without having to refresh the page.</p>
